I did as much as I could and gave it my best shot so I think I deserve an 8.

I learned the difference between Git and GitHub and understand now the great uses of these two platforms
I set up a GitHub public account with a username, password, license and .gitignore file

I created a repository called 'Bioinformatics' 
I collaborated with Lucas (as well as you) and added files to his repository
As we were collaborators this allowed him to edit my repository by adding lots of his own files without my final consent.
This is the difference between collaborators and contributors - do you trust him/her enough?

I forked with other repositories which allowed me to make changes to this repository and then I could request a pull, 
which could either be accepted or denied by the owner of said repository

I used a few commands throughout this exercise:

git pull	pull data from the Github to your Git
git push	push staged files back to the GitHub repository
git commit -m "text"	make committed files and option to add a message
git status	status of your git

I opened issues that were acted upon

I accepted pull requests and merged conflicts

I created screenshots that are in my README.md file to illustrate with screenshots some of what I did and where my profile
is at so far

I will be playing and learning more uses of GitHub very soon.

Thanks a lot for the enthusiastic intro!
